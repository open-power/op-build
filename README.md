# OpenPOWER Firmware Build Environment

The OpenPOWER firmware build process uses Buildroot to create a toolchain and
build the various components of the PNOR firmware, including Hostboot, Skiboot,
OCC, Petitboot etc.

## Development

## Building an image

To build an image for a Palmetto system:

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:open-power/op-build.git
cd op-build
. op-build-env
op-build palmetto_defconfig && op-build
```

There are also default configurations for other platforms in
`openpower/configs/` such as Habanero and Firestone.

Buildroot/op-build supports both native and cross-compilation - it will
automatically download and build an appropriate toolchain as part of the build
process, so you don't need to worry about setting up a
cross-compiler. Cross-compiling from a x86-64 host is officially supported.

### Dependencies for *64-bit* Ubuntu/Debian systems

1. Install Ubuntu (>= 14.04) or Debian (>= 7.5) 64-bit.
2. Enable Universe (Ubuntu only):

        sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
        sudo add-apt-repository universe
3. Install the packages necessary for the build:

        sudo apt-get install cscope ctags libz-dev libexpat-dev \
          python language-pack-en texinfo \

          libxml-simple-perl libxml-sax-perl libxml2-dev libxml2-utils xsltproc \
          wget bc

### Dependencies for *64-bit* Fedora systems

1. Install Fedora 25 64-bit (older Fedora should also work).
2. Install the packages necessary for the build:
