Subject: [PATCH 16/17] linux: configure CONFIG_I2C_OPAL as in-built.

Currently, skiroot_defconfig CONFIG_I2C_OPAL is built as a loadable
module rather than builtin, even if CONFIG_I2C=y is defined. This
results in a delay in the TPM initialization, causing IMA to go into
TPM bypass mode. As a result, the IMA measurements are added to the
measurement list, but do not extend the TPM. Because of this, it is
impossible to verify or attest to the system's integrity, either from
skiroot or the target Host OS.

Mimi Zohar <zohar@linux.ibm.com> explains more:

  The concept of trusted boot requires the measurement to be added to the
  measurement list and extend the TPM, prior to allowing access to the
  file. By allowing access to a file before its measurement is included
  in the measurement list and extended into the TPM PCR, a malicious file
  could potentially prevent its own measurement from being added. As the
  PCRs are tamper proof, measuring and extending the TPM prior to giving
  access to the file, guarantees that all file measurements are included
  in the measurement list, including the malicious file.

  IMA needs to be enabled before any files are accessed in order to
  verify a file's integrity and extend the TPM with the file
  measurement.  Queueing file measurements breaks the measure and extend,
  before usage, trusted boot paradigm.

  The ima-evm-utils package includes a test for walking the IMA
  measurement list, calculating the expected TPM PCRs, and comparing the
  calculated PCR values with the physical TPM.  Testing is important to
  ensure the TPM is initialized prior to IMA.  Failure to validate the
  IMA measurement list may indicate IMA went into TPM bypass mode, like
  in this case.
