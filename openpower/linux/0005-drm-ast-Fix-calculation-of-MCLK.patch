Subject: [PATCH 05/13] drm/ast: Fix calculation of MCLK

Some braces were missing causing an incorrect calculation.

Y.C. Chen from Aspeed provided me with the right formula
which I tested on AST2400 and 2500.

The MCLK isn't currently used by the driver (it will eventually
to filter modes) so the issue isn't catastrophic.

Also make the printed value a bit more meaningful
